# Sprint 2

# Check for token_id Details

### t table: join transactions and token_transfers table

```sql
with t as (
select tk_tr.value token_id, tr.block_timestamp, 
		tk_tr.block_timestamp, receipt_gas_used, 
		(receipt_gas_used*0.0000036756792144+66.1136)*20/3600 *0.0004 watt_per_tran
FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions` tr 
	join `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.token_transfers` tk_tr 
    on tr.`hash` = tk_tr.transaction_hash
where tr.to_address = lower('0x1a92f7381b9f03921564a437210bb9396471050c')) 

```

### Strange token_id

```sql
select distinct (token_id) from t  
where length(token_id) >= 5
```

### Total number of transactions with strange token_id

```sql
select count(*) total_tran_with_strange_token from t  
where length(token_id) >= 8
```

### token_id â‰¤ 5 with hash

```sql
select token_id, transaction_hash, block_timestamp, tr_from, tr_to, 
		tk_tr_from, tk_tr_to, receipt_gas_used, watt_per_tran, 
    dense_rank() over(partition by token_id order by block_timestamp) rn  
from t
where length(token_id) <= 5
order by token_id, transaction_hash
```

# Two Scenario

### 1. Same hash with different token

![Untitled](imgs/Untitled%203.png)

![Untitled](imgs/Untitled%204.png)

In this scenario, token was transferred from null address, which means new token was minted. Since it has the same hash and the gas fee was paid in one time. 

I think when we calculate gas for this kind of token we should use:

**receipt_gas_used / number of different token_id within same hash**

### 2. Same token with different hash

![Untitled](imgs/Untitled%205.png)

![Untitled](imgs/Untitled%206.png)

In this scenario, the same token has been transferred in different time and result in different receipt_gas_used. The two transactions are independent to each other. 

I think when we calculate gas for this kind of token we should use:

**avg(receipt_gas_used) group by token_id**

### 3. Token transfer to erc20

# Calculate gas for each token

1. aggregate gas resulted from all transactions for each token 

```sql
select distinct token_id, accumulative_gas_fee, 
	(accumulative_gas_fee*0.0000036756792144+66.1136)*20/3600 *0.0004 watt_per_tran
from 
(
select token_id, 
sum(receipt_gas_used) over(partition by token_id) accumulative_gas_fee from t
) t2 
order by 1
```
