During sprint 1 and sprint 2, I'm trying to build a carbon emission model for one ETH transaction.

Basically, I will answer the following queestions and reord our models.

1. How ETH transaction work

2. In which phase of transmision will lead to carbon emission

3. Existing ETH emission estimation and their limits



Transaction model V1.0

Transaction model V2.0
